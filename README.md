A simple cantilever beam problem with the fixed support at left end and a single point force at right end was considered. Several optimized structures were produced by varying the parameters like volume fraction, penalty factor, filter radius, etc. and using the open-source topology optimization code TOPOPT [3]. The boundary conditions were kept same for generating optimized structures at low resolution (32*32) as well as at high resolution (128*128). These datasets were divided into training dataset for the training (or learning) process and test dataset for performance evaluation. The CNN-based encoder and decoder network was trained with the training dataset generated at low resolution. Then, for progressive refinement, the conditional GAN was trained with the paired optimized structures at both low and high resolutions
